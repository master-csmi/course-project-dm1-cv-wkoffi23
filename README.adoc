= GitHub Classroom Assignment: Create Your CV
:experimental: true
:icons: font

This assignment guides you to create a professional CV in **LaTeX** using **Git** and **GitHub** from **VS Code** (locally or in **GitHub Codespaces**). You will personalize a provided template and publish your final PDF via a **GitHub Release**.

toc::[]

[NOTE]
====
You may work **locally in VS Code** or **entirely in the browser** using https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/codespaces[GitHub Codespaces]. Codespaces gives you a ready-to-use dev environment without installing LaTeX locally.
====

TIP: You can preview this README in VS Code using the *AsciiDoctor* extension (auto-recommended). After installing, click the preview button (top-right). image:vscode-asciidoc-preview.png[inline]

== What you will learn
* Core Git workflow: clone, branch, commit, push, pull request, merge.
* Working with **GitHub Classroom** assignments.
* Editing and compiling LaTeX in **VS Code** (via *LaTeX Workshop*).
* Packaging deliverables using **GitHub Releases**.

== Requirements
* GitHub account and the **Classroom invitation link** (provided by your instructor).
* **VS Code** locally _or_ **GitHub Codespaces**.
* Replace the sample photo with **your own** (mandatory).
* Commit frequently with **meaningful messages**.

== Getting Started

1. **Accept the assignment**
   * Open the Classroom invitation link and click btn:[Accept this assignment].
   * A private repository will be created for you.

2. **Open your repository**
   * **Option A — Codespaces (recommended):**
     * On your repo page → btn:[Code] → tab:[Codespaces] → btn:[Create codespace on main].
   * **Option B — Local VS Code:**
     * Clone the repository and open the folder in VS Code:
+
[source,console]
----
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git
code <repository-name>
----

== Repository tour
You should see at least:
* `main.tex` — main LaTeX source for your CV.
* `simplehipstercv.cls`, `simplehipstercv.sty` — class/style files.
* Images (e.g., `jack.jpg`) — replace with your own portrait.

[IMPORTANT]
====
**Photo:** Replace `jack.jpg` with your own photo **or** update the LaTeX path if you change the filename.
====

== Edit your CV (LaTeX)
1. Open `main.tex` in VS Code and update sections:
   * Name, Title, Contact
   * Education / Degrees
   * Skills & Programming Languages
   * Experience / Projects
   * Languages & Certifications
2. Replace the profile photo:
+
[source,latex]
----
\includegraphics[width=1.1\linewidth]{jack.jpg} % rename or update path if needed
----

== Preview / Build the PDF
* Install **LaTeX Workshop** (auto-recommended on open) and run “LaTeX Workshop: Build LaTeX project” from the Command Palette (btn:[Ctrl+Shift+P] / btn:[Cmd+Shift+P] on macOS).
* Or build from a terminal:
+
[source,console]
----
pdflatex main.tex
----
* Repeat until the PDF builds cleanly (review warnings/errors).

[NOTE]
====
If building **locally**, ensure a LaTeX distribution is installed (e.g., TeX Live/MiKTeX). With **Codespaces**, the environment can be preconfigured by your instructor or you can install what you need inside the container.
====

== Git workflow to demonstrate
1. Create a short-lived feature branch:
+
[source,console]
----
git checkout -b feature/fill-education
----
2. Make small, focused commits with clear messages:
+
[source,console]
----
git add main.tex
git commit -m "Add education section with MSc details"
git push -u origin feature/fill-education
----
3. Open a **Pull Request** on GitHub → review (self/peer) → **Merge** into `main`.
4. Repeat once more for another part (e.g., experience or skills).

[IMPORTANT]
====
Commit **early and often**. Push regularly to back up your work.
====

== Create a Release (final packaging)
1. Ensure `main.pdf` is up to date and error-free.
2. On GitHub → tab:[Releases] → btn:[Draft a new release].
3. Set:
   * **Tag:** `v1.0`
   * **Title:** `Final CV`
   * **Notes:** brief summary of what you finalized.
4. **Attach** your `main.pdf` as a release asset.
5. Click btn:[Publish release].

== Submission
Submit the **Release URL** in the LMS (or as instructed).

== Grading checklist (100 pts)

* Git hygiene (30 pts): ≥6 meaningful commits; clear messages; one small PR merged.
* Repository quality (20 pts): clean tree; sensible `.gitignore`; no huge binaries in history.
* CV content & structure (30 pts): complete, concise sections; consistent formatting.
* Release packaging (20 pts): `v1.0` release with `main.pdf` attached.

== Common issues & fixes

* **Image not visible:** check filename/extension; ensure the path in `\includegraphics{}` matches; avoid spaces in names.
* **LaTeX fails to compile:** read the log for missing packages or typos (unbalanced braces, bad characters). Rebuild after each fix.
* **Push/auth errors:** verify GitHub sign-in; confirm `origin` URL; run `git status` to check branch and staged files.
* **Accents/UTF-8:** ensure your source is UTF-8 encoded; include proper LaTeX packages if needed.

== Good practice
* Keep your CV to **1–2 pages**; prioritize impact and recency.
* Use action verbs and metrics (e.g., “Implemented…, reduced runtime by 35% on EuroHPC”).
* Avoid sensitive personal data. Ensure the photo is your own and that you have rights to any included assets.
